# davrOS 
Popular British Science Fiction Linux Distro.

Not yet suitable for production usage.
## Install
Run this <b>as root</b> on any Arch Linux based distro:
```shell
if command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  curl -fsSL "https://davros.netlify.app/post-install.sh" > davros
  curl -fsSL "https://davros.netlify.app/pkg.txt" > pkg.txt
else
  wget "https://davros.netlify.app/post-install.sh"
  wget "https://davros.netlify.app/pkg.txt"
  mv post-install.sh davros
fi
chmod +x davros
./davros
```

## Upgrade davrOS
Run this as root on your davrOS system. This will also work on any other Arch-Based distro but it will just install and upgrade packages that davrOS installs by default.
```shell
if command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  curl -fsSL "https://davros.netlify.app/upgrade.sh" > davros
  curl -fsSL "https://davros.netlify.app/pkg.txt" > pkg.txt
else
  wget "https://davros.netlify.app/upgrade.sh"
  wget "https://davros.netlify.app/pkg.txt"
  mv upgrade.sh davros
fi
chmod +x davros
./davros
```
Note: Upgrading may be network intensive and may take time.
